# COSC 4F90

This project was done as my undergraduate thesis for Brock University.

The main premise was to implement some particle swarm optimizer variants for the multiple sequence alignment problem, and perform experiments on their quality of solutions.

For in-depth information on what was done, read the [thesis](https://github.com/Pixelatory/cosc4f90/blob/master/4F90_Thesis.pdf).
